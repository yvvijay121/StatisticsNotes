# Z-Scores
The *$z$-score* is simply a measure of how many standard deviations away a certain value in a distribution is from the mean. ^1db326

$$z_{x_i}=\frac{x_i-\bar{x}}{s}$$

The *$z$-score* is positive when $x$ is above the mean, and it is negative when $x$ is below the mean.

$z$-scores are best used on approximately normal distributions, and aren't the best when describing a [[Shapes of Quantitative Distributions#Skew|skewed]] distribution or a distribution with [[Unusual Features of a Quantitative Distribution#Outliers|outliers]]. ^1b19e1
