title: Five-Number Summary
---
The five-number summary of a dataset consists of the following:
- minimum value
- first/lower quartile ($Q_1$)
- median
- third/upper quartile ($Q_3$)
- maximum value

You can get these values from `One-Variable Statistics` on your calculator.

## Quartiles
The medians of the upper and lower halves of the distribution, not including the media itself in either half, and called *quartiles*.

The median of the lower half is called the *lower quartile*, or the *first quartile*. The median of the upper half is called the *upper quartile*, or the *third quartile*.

The *interquartile range* (IQR) is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile. ^0d6775
