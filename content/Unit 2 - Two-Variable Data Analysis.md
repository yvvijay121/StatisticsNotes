title: Unit 2 - Two-Variable Data Analysis
---
Two-variable (or *bivariate*) [[Quantitative Data|quantitative data]] is data where we compare two different variables, and whether there is a [[Correlation|correlation]] between the two variables.

The *explanatory variable* (or the *independent variable*) is the variable in the bivariate distribution that we are assuming is the variable that *affects* the other variable. The *response variable* (or the *dependent variable*) is the variable in the bivariate distribution that we are assuming is the variable that is *affected by* the other variable.

> Note: Most of the content in this unit is analyzed using a *scatterplot*, which shows the data by graphing it between two axis that [[Correlation|correlate]] to the two [[Quantitative Data|quantitative]] variables.

## [[Correlation]]

Correlations expresses the extent to which two variables are associated.

## [[Linear Models]]

Linear models are used to predict response values from explanatory values in a bivariate distribution.

## Residuals
A *residual* is a value that simply describes the difference between the value of the response variable and the predicted response variable from the [[Linear Models|line of best fit]] given the explanatory variable. The notation is normally $y-\hat{y}$.

## Coefficients of Determination
A *coefficient of determination* is the proportion of the variability in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. Usually notated as $R^2$.

Sometimes, if we see an apparent non-linear association in our bivarate data, we may choose to transform the data to fit a linear model.
