# $\chi^2$ Test for Independence
A test of independence examines the association between two variables in a single population.

## Hypotheses
- $H_0$: Variables are independent of each other
	- There is no association between row variable vs. column variable.
- $H_A$: Variables are dependent on each other
	- There is an association between row variable vs. column variable.
