title: Shapes of Quantitative Distributions
---
Describing the shape of a quantitative distribution consists of two parts:
- Skew
- Modality

## Skew
If the graph is symmetric when using the middle of the graph as the line of reflection, the graph is *approximately normal.*

Otherwise, if one tail of the graph stretches out farther than the other, the histogram is said to be *skewed* to the side of the longer tail.

> Tip: Draw a curve along the skewed graph. The direction that you are sketching to the tail of the graph is the direction that the graph is skewed.

### Formal Definition
- Skewed left: The spread of data below the median is greater than the spread of data above the median.
- Skewed right: The spread of data above the median is greater than the spread of data below the median.

## Modality
Peaks in a histogram are called modes; therefore, the modality of the graph describes how many "peaks" there are in the distribution.
- Unimodal: one peak
- Bimodal: two peaks
- Multimodal: > three peaks
- Uniform: no peaks in the distribution
