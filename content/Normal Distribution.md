The *normal distribution* is a type of [[Quantitative Data#^a7c31b|continuous]] probability distribution for a random variable. The normal distribution is usually used as an idealization of many distributions of random variables.

The normal distribution is symmetrical and unimodal, centered at the mean of the sample, as seen above.

> Note: When doing a problem relating to the normal distribution, **always** draw a normal curve, and shade or a draw a line that relates to the solution to the problem. Make sure to notate the curve with the notation $N(\mu,\sigma)$.

## 68-95-99.7 Rule

The *68-95-99.7 rule* (or the *empirical rule*), states the following:
- 68% of the values in the normal distribution are within one [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] of the mean.
- 95% of the values in the normal distribution are within two [[Standard Deviation|standard deviations]] of the mean.
- 99.7% of the values in the normal distribution are within three [[Standard Deviation|standard deviations]] of the mean.

## Standard Normal Distribution

The *standard normal distribution* is a special example of the normal distribution, where the mean ($\mu$) is 0, and the standard deviation ($\sigma$) is 1.

## Mathematical Representation of the Normal Curve
$${f(x)={\frac {1}{\sigma {\sqrt {2\pi }}}}e^{-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {x-\mu }{\sigma }}\right)^{2}}}$$
Don't need this, but it's cool.
