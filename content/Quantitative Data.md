title: Quantitative Data
---
*Quantitative data*, or *numerical data* are measures or counts.

## Discrete and Continuous Variables
*Discrete variables* are variables that are distinct, separated values. An example is the number of people in a household; you can't have 2.5 people in a household. Therefore, this is an example of a discrete variable.

*Continuous variables* are variables that can be any value in an interval. An example is the width of a sheet of paper; this could have any measurement. ^a7c31b

## Describing a Quantitative Distribution
A distribution shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur.

**The features that we mention when describing a quantitative distribution are [[Shapes of Quantitative Distributions|shape]], [[Measures of Center for Quantitative Distributions|center]], [[Measures of Spread for Quantitative Distributions|spread]], and [[Unusual Features of a Quantitative Distribution|unusual features]].** ^5bef99

Make sure to review how to describe each of these features by looking at the links above; you may use different statistics to describe these features based on the distribution.
