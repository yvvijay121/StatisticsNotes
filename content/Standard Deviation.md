title: Standard Deviation
---
The *standard deviation* is defined as the typical difference between a value in the distribution and the average for the distribution. ^5e9145

Mathematically, the standard deviation is defined as the square root of the *variance* of the distribution, which is defined as the average squared deviation from the mean of the distribution. A deviation is the distance that a data value is from the mean. ^da115c

$$s=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum{(x-\bar{x})^2}}$$

> If you are referring to a sample statistic, use $s$. If you are referring to a population parameter, use $\sigma$.

The standard deviation is very useful for three reasons:
- The standard deviation is independent of the mean.
- The standard deviation measures the [[Measures of Spread for Quantitative Distributions|spread]] of the distribution.
- The standard deviation is independent of the size of the distribution.

### Formula for Variance
$$s^2=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum{(x-\bar{x})^2}$$
