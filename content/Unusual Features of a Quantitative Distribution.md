title: Unusual Features of a Quantitative Distribution
---
Distributions can have many unusual features, which can affect descriptions and generalizations of the distributions.

## Outliers
An *outlier* is a value in the distribution that is extremely far away from the rest of the points in the distribution.

To identify potential outliers in the distribution, use the [[Five-Number Summary|IQR]] to create an "outlier fence". Any points outside of this "outlier fence" and potential outliers.
- higher outlier fence $=Q_3 + 1.5(IQR)$
- lower outlier fence $=Q_1 - 1.5(IQR)$
