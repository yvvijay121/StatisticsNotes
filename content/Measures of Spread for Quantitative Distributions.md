# Spread of Distribution
There are multiple values that can represent the spread of the distribution

## Variance and [[Standard Deviation]]
![[Standard Deviation#^5e9145]]
The *variance* is the square of the [[standard deviation]].

## Range
The *range* of the distribution is simply the difference between the greatest value and the smallest value in the distribution.

> Warning: If the distribution has extreme values, is extremely skewed, or has outliers, the range will not be a good representation of the spread of the data.
