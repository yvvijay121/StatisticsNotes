## Normal Cumulative Distribution Function
The normal cumulative distribution function (normCdf) can find the proportion of the area under the normal curve that lies between two values in the normal distribution.

Simply plug in the lower and upper bounds, the mean, and the standard deviation of the function to get the proportion of the area (and therefore the proportion of the distribution) that lies between the bounds.

## Inverse Normal Function
The inverse normal function (invNorm) is the opposite of the normal cumulative distribution function.

Plug in the area, the mean, and the standard deviation to get the value that bounds the area specified.
