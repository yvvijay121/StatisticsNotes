## $\chi^2$ Models
$\chi^2$ models are used to compare counts of categorical data when comparing the observed distribution(s) to the expected distribution(s) of data.

There are three types of $\chi^2$ models:
- One Population/Distribution Analysis
	- $\chi^2$ Test for Goodness-Of-Fit ($\chi^2$ GOF)
		- This test compares the observed counts of a *single* categorical variable to the expected distribution.
- Comparing Two Populations/Distributions
	- $\chi^2$ Test of Homogeneity
		- Compares the distribution of one categorical variable over two different populations.
	- $\chi^2$ Test of Independence
		- Compares the distributions of two categorical variables over a single population.
### Performing The Test
There are four general parts to creating and justifying a $\chi^2$ test:
- Assumptions and Conditions
- Hypotheses
	- Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)
	- Alternate Hypothesis ($H_A$)
- Calculations
- Conclusions (based on $p$-value from calculation)

These factors will change slightly based on the type of $\chi^2$ test you are performing.
### General Notes About $\chi^2$ Tests
Other important facts about the $\chi^2$ *statistic*:
- The $\chi^2$ statistic is used only for testing hypotheses, not for constructing confidence intervals.
- If the observed counts donâ€™t match the expected, the statistic will be large.
- The $\chi^2$ test statistic is always positive.

*Linear regression $t$ tests* are used to quantify the relationship between a
predictor variable and a response variable.
