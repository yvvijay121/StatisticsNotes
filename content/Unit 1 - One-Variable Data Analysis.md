# Unit 1: One-Variable Data Analysis
## Parameters & Statistics
Values that describe a sample are called *statistics*, and values that describe a population are called *parameters*.

## [[Quantitative Data]] & [[Qualitative Data]]
- *Quantitative data*, orÂ *numerical data* are measures or counts.
- *Qualitative data*, or *categorical data,* are data that can be classified into a group based on a non-numerical characteristic.

A further distinction can be made between discrete and continuous variables; see [[Quantitative Data]] for more information.

## Graphical Representations for [[Qualitative Data]]
- Bar Chart: displays the distribution of a *categorical variable*, showing the counts for each category in bars.
	- Relative Frequency Bar Chart: This type of bar chart displays the *relative proportion* of counts for each category.
	- Segmented Bar Chart: Each bar is divided *proportionally* into segments corresponding to the *percentages* of each category.
	- Note: Make sure to look at the axes, which will tell you whether the information is relative or absolute.
	- Side by Side Bar Charts: The total height for all the bars in each category should add up to 100%.
- Pie Charts: These graphs show the whole group of categories as slices of a circle; each piece is proportional to the fraction of the whole.
- Frequency Tables: These record the totals and the names of each category.
	- Relative Frequency Table: Same thing, but with percentages.
- Two-way tables: Used to visualize two different categorical variables, and how they are distributed in relation to each other.

## Graphical Representations for [[Quantitative Data]]
- Stem & Leaf Plot: Stem-and-leaf displays show the distribution of a quantitative variable while preserving the individual values.
- Dotplot: A dotplot places a dot along an axis for each case in the data.
- Box-and-Whisker Plot: A box-and-whisker plot is a visualization of the [[Five-Number Summary]].
- Histogram: A histogram plots the bin counts of a quantitative variable as the heights of bars.
- Timeplot: A timeplot of a variable plots each observation against the time at which it was measured.
	- Time should always be placed on the horizontal axis.

![[Quantitative Data#Describing a Quantitative Distribution]]

## Ogives (Cumulative Frequency Graph Definition)
An *ogive* is a graph where the $p^{th}$ percentile of a distribution is the value such that $p$ percent of the observations fall at or below it.

## Percentile Rank of a Term
The *percentile rank* of a term is the proportion of terms in the distribution that are less than or equal to that term.
