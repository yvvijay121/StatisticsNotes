# Measures of Center
There are two primary measures of center, *mean* and *median*. *Mode*, which is the most commonly occurring value in the distribution, may be seen. Don't use mode.

## Mean
The *mean* (informally the *average*) of the distribution is defined as the sum of all of the values in the distribution divided by the number of values in the distribution.
$$\bar{x}=\frac{\sum{x}}{n}$$
$\bar{x}$ is used for the mean of a sample (statistic), and $\mu$ is used for mean of the population (parameter).

## Median
The *median* of a distribution is the value in the middle of the ordered distribution. At least half of the values in the distribution are smaller than the median, and at least half of the values in the distribution are greater than the median.

If the distribution has an even number of values, the median is the mean of the two center values.

## Resistance
When it comes to choosing whether to use the mean or the median in a certain distribution, it is important to look at the distribution's shape, and whether it has any unusual features.

If the distribution is approximately symmetric and has no unusual features, it is fine to use either the mean or the media. However, if the distribution is skewed or has outliers, it is better to use the median, since the mean is heavily affected by extremely large or extremely small values.

Therefore, the mean is defined as a *resistant statistic*, since it is not heavily influenced by extreme values.
